A full reimplementation of IBM Pascal 2.0, a compiler targeting LLVM IR with semantic analysis in a dedicated type-checking phase. Built to handle the vintage Pascal-1981 dialect with all its systems-programming extensions (`adr`, `sizeof`, `adrmem`, `word`, `extern`) — the features that made Pascal suitable for low-level operating system and firmware work in the early 1980s.

## Quick Start

Compile a Pascal program to a native executable:

```bash
# Pascal source -> LLVM IR  (parse + type-check + codegen)
python3 compile_to_llvm.py myprogram.pas myprogram.ll

# LLVM IR -> native executable (requires clang).
# Link the C runtime: file I/O, READ/READLN, string intrinsics,
# ENCODE/DECODE, and friends resolve against runtime/*.c.
clang myprogram.ll runtime/*.c -o myprogram

# Run it
./myprogram
```

Programs whose output lowers to bare `printf` (e.g. `WRITELN` of integers)
link without the runtime, but anything touching files, READ, or the string
intrinsics will fail with `undefined reference to pas_...` unless
`runtime/*.c` is on the link line.

Add `-v` / `--verbose` for detailed output and full Python tracebacks if compilation fails:

```bash
python3 compile_to_llvm.py -v myprogram.pas myprogram.ll
```

Optional dialect extensions are controlled with feature flags. The default dialect is vintage IBM Pascal behavior; wider integer types and symbolic enum I/O are off unless explicitly enabled:

```bash
# Show available feature flags
python3 compile_to_llvm.py --list-features

# Enable INTEGER32 / INTEGER64 and MAXINT32 / MAXINT64
python3 compile_to_llvm.py -f wide-integers myprogram.pas myprogram.ll

# Enable name-based user enum WRITE and READ as an extension
python3 compile_to_llvm.py -f symbolic-enum-io myprogram.pas myprogram.ll
```

If no output file is specified, LLVM IR is written to stdout:

```bash
python3 compile_to_llvm.py myprogram.pas | clang -x ir - runtime/*.c -o myprogram
```

## Architecture

A clean, layered pipeline with clear separation of concerns:

```
Pascal Source -> Lexer -> Parser -> Type Checker -> Codegen -> LLVM IR -> clang -> Executable
```

### Design Philosophy

Each phase is independent and focused:
- **Front end** (lexer, parser, type checker) is pure Python with no LLVM dependency
- **Errors stop the pipeline early** — type errors are reported before any IR is generated
- **No surprise failures** — if compilation succeeds, the generated code will link and run

### Components

- **Lexer (`lexer.py`)** — tokenizes Pascal source: keywords, identifiers, numbers, operators, strings.
- **Parser (`parser.py`)** — builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens. Implements the full IBM Pascal 2.0 grammar. Entry point: `parse_file(path)`.
- **Type Checker (`type_system.py`, `symbol_table.py`, `type_checker.py`)** — semantic analysis: validates types, scopes, control flow, and module semantics before code generation. All type violations stop the pipeline with clear error messages.
- **Feature flags (`features.py`)** — generic feature-gating machinery for opt-in dialect extensions such as `wide-integers` and `symbolic-enum-io`.
- **Type Checker support (`builtins_registry.py`)** — centralized registration of predeclared identifiers (types, constants, intrinsics); user declarations may shadow builtins.
- **Codegen (`codegen/` package)** — walks the AST and emits LLVM IR using `llvmlite`. Split by concern: `base`, `decls`, `exprs`, `stmts`, `types_map`, `constfold`, plus feature modules `files` (file-control blocks), `io_write_read`, `strings`, `sets`, and `runtime_builtins`. `codegen_llvm.py` remains as a compatibility shim re-exporting the package.
- **C Runtime (`runtime/`)** — the file I/O subsystem (`fileops.c`: FCB model, RESET/REWRITE/GET/PUT, ASSIGN/CLOSE/DISCARD, READSET/READFN, EOF/EOLN, mode enforcement), stdin readers (`readq.c`), ENCODE/DECODE (`encode_decode.c`), and the move/scan/fill/position intrinsics.
- **Linking** — `clang` lowers LLVM IR to native code and links `runtime/*.c`.

### Grammar Reference

The grammar this dialect implements is formally specified in [`docs/ebnf_grammar.md`](docs/ebnf_grammar.md). The parser test suite is graded against this grammar as the source of truth.

## Supported Language Features

This compiler implements the full IBM Pascal 2.0 language, including all semantic rules and dialectal extensions.

### Types
- `INTEGER` (16-bit signed, matching IBM Pascal 2.0; range `-32768..32767`; `MAXINT = 32767`)
- `INTEGER32` / `INTEGER64` (opt-in extension types enabled with `-f wide-integers`; also enables `MAXINT32` and `MAXINT64`)
- `BOOLEAN` (one byte; stored as `i8` so address-of / `sizeof` / fills are byte-consistent)
- `REAL` (64-bit float; constants, division, unary minus, and mixed arithmetic are codegen-hardened, and the default `WRITE` format matches the manual's 14-wide exponential, e.g. `WRITE(123.456)` prints ` 1.2345600E+02`)
- `WORD` (16-bit unsigned)
- `CHAR` (8-bit)
- `ARRAY[low..high] OF type` — bounds may be constant expressions, including named `CONST`s
- `RECORD ... END`
- `SET OF type` — 256-bit bitvector representation; constant constructors fold at compile time
- Enumerated types (`TYPE color = (RED, GREEN, BLUE)`)
- `STRING(n)` (fixed, blank-padded) and `LSTRING(n)` (length-prefixed) string storage
- `TEXT` and binary `FILE OF T` file types, with the buffer variable `F^` backed by an inline file-control block
- Predeclared `FILEMODES` enum (`SEQUENTIAL`, `TERMINAL`, `DIRECT`) and `FCBFQQ` record; `F.MODE` is readable and assignable on file variables
- Pointers, plus the `adrmem` (generic address) parameter type

### Declarations
- `VAR x, y: INTEGER`
- `CONST size = 8190` — constant values are folded and usable in array bounds, `sizeof`, and expressions
- `PROCEDURE name(params); ... END`
- `FUNCTION name(params): type; ... END`
- `TYPE name = type`
- `EXTERN` / `FORWARD` / `EXTERNAL` procedures (link against external/C objects)

### Statements
- `IF cond THEN stmt ELSE stmt`
- `WHILE cond DO stmt`
- `REPEAT stmt UNTIL cond`
- `FOR var := start TO/DOWNTO end DO stmt`
- `CASE expr OF cases END`
- `BEGIN stmt; stmt; ... END`
- procedure / function calls

### Expressions
- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `DIV`, `MOD`
- Logic: `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`
- Comparison: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- Calls: `func(args)`
- Systems-programming operators: `adr x` (address-of), `sizeof(x)` / `sizeof(type)`
- Built-ins: `CHR`, `ORD`, plus the intrinsic families `ENCODE`/`DECODE`, `SCANEQ`/`SCANNE`, `POSITN`, and the move/fill block operations

### Built-in I/O
- `WRITE`/`WRITELN` — mixed integers, characters, booleans, enums, REALs, strings, and string literals, with `:width`/`:width:frac` field formatting; an optional leading `TEXT` file argument selects the output stream (default `OUTPUT`/stdout). User enum values print as ordinals by default, matching IBM Pascal 2.0; `-f symbolic-enum-io` switches user enum output to member names. BOOLEAN always writes `TRUE`/`FALSE`, independent of that flag. The `::N` precision operand on STRING/LSTRING values is ignored by default (matching the vintage compiler, which prints the whole value); `-f string-precision` makes it truncate to `N` characters.
- `READ`/`READLN` — scalar and string targets, with an optional leading `TEXT` file argument (default `INPUT`/stdin). User enum READ accepts numeric ordinals by default; `-f symbolic-enum-io` switches enum READ to symbolic member names, gated together with symbolic enum WRITE so same-mode enum round-trips stay coherent.
- File primitives — `RESET`, `REWRITE`, `GET`, `PUT`, and the buffer variable `F^`, over an inline file-control block with a single fill path shared by `F^`, the predicates, and the formatted readers
- Extended I/O verbs — `ASSIGN` (filename binding; `CHR(0)` spells a temporary file), `CLOSE`, `DISCARD`, `READSET` (scan characters in a `SET OF CHAR`; the delimiter set must be a declared `SET OF CHAR` value, matching the vintage compiler — an inline set-constructor literal such as `['A'..'Z']` is rejected unless `-f readset-set-literal` is enabled), `READFN` (READLN-like dispatcher that binds filenames to file parameters)
- Stream predicates — `EOF` and `EOLN`, with line markers presented as blanks per the manual
- Mode enforcement — writing a file in inspection mode, writing a closed file, or reading a file in generation mode aborts with a runtime error rather than corrupting data

## Systems-Programming Extensions

These are the features that made Pascal suitable for writing operating systems, firmware, and device drivers. They allow direct memory manipulation while maintaining Pascal's type safety where possible:

- **`adr x`** — yields the address of a variable. Lowered to the variable's LLVM pointer, enabling low-level code.
- **`sizeof(x)` / `sizeof(T)`** — compile-time byte size, computed from real array bounds (constants are resolved) and element sizes; returns a `WORD`. Essential for buffer and layout calculations.
- **`adrmem`** — a generic address/pointer parameter type (`i8*` in LLVM). Pointer arguments are automatically bitcast to the parameter's type at the call site, enabling polymorphic low-level functions. Example: `adr flags` (an array pointer) can be passed where an `adrmem` is expected.
- **`extern` procedures** — declared without a body and resolved at link time. Enables linking Pascal code against C runtimes and external libraries.
- **`word` type** — 16-bit unsigned integer for register and hardware register operations.
- **Feature-gated wide integers** — `INTEGER32` and `INTEGER64` are available only with `-f wide-integers`; unflagged builds preserve the vintage 16-bit `INTEGER` surface.


## Project Scope

This is a **full reimplementation** of IBM Pascal 2.0. The goal is not a subset or tutorial language, but complete dialect coverage as specified in the original IBM Pascal 2.0 manual. 

**Reference:** The original compiler manual is [here](https://archive.org/details/ibm-pascal-compiler-aug-81) — this is the source of truth for dialect semantics and feature completeness.

Dialect coverage is complete: the planned feature checklist has been worked through, and the remaining differential questions against the genuine 1981 compiler have been settled and recorded in [`docs/discrepancies.md`](docs/discrepancies.md). Behaviors that the vintage compiler does not have, but that this implementation offers as deliberate extensions, are gated behind opt-in feature flags (see `features.py` / `--list-features`) so the default build stays faithful to IBM Pascal 2.0. The formal grammar lives in [`docs/ebnf_grammar.md`](docs/ebnf_grammar.md), and the executed remediation plans are kept under [`docs/plans/`](docs/plans/) for the record.

The test suite is organized to run independently at each layer, so development can proceed without the full LLVM toolchain.

## Testing

One unified test suite built on Python's stdlib `unittest`, with automatic detection of optional dependencies. Tests are organized by **pipeline layer**, so you can run the subset relevant to your changes without requiring the full LLVM toolchain.

### Run the entire test suite

```bash
# All tests; codegen tests auto-skip if llvmlite/clang are unavailable
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

### Run by layer

```bash
# Parser accept/reject corpus + type rules (no llvmlite needed)
python3 -m unittest tests.test_parser tests.test_typecheck

# Codegen only (requires llvmlite + clang)
python3 -m unittest tests.test_codegen
```

### Test Organization

- **`tests/test_parser.py`** — Parser accept/reject verdicts over a fixture corpus:
  - `should_pass/` — programs that conform to the grammar and MUST parse
  - `should_fail/` — programs that violate the grammar and MUST be rejected
  - `judgment_calls/` — edge cases where the dialect spec allows discretion
  
  No subprocess or stdout grepping; verdicts come from catching `(ParserError, LexerError)`. Each fixture runs in a `subTest` for isolated failure reporting.

- **`tests/test_typecheck.py`** — Type rules, scope, compatibility, control flow, and module semantics. Organized by topic into `TestCase` classes (`TestVariableScope`, `TestTypeCompatibility`, `TestModuleSemantics`, etc.). In-process; no subprocess or `llvmlite` dependency.

- **`tests/test_codegen.py`** — LLVM IR generation and native build/run tests. Decorated with `@requires_llvm` (IR tests) and `@requires_exe` (build/run tests). Automatically skipped if the toolchain is unavailable; the suite still exits 0.

- **`tests/test_codegen_strings_bounds.py`** — string-intrinsic capacity semantics, WRITE field-width ordering, and READ dispatch guards at the IR and run level.

- **`tests/test_read_end_to_end.py`** — piped-stdin READ/READLN run tests across scalar and string types.

- **`tests/test_runtime_fixes.py`** — hostile run tests pinning previously-wrong runtime behaviors: NEW sizing, ENCODE/DECODE, SCANNE, and the file subsystem (buffer-variable model, RESET/GET interleaves, mode-enforcement aborts, ASSIGN/CLOSE/DISCARD/READSET/READFN).

- **`tests/test_integration.py`** — Legacy integration corpus (currently removed from supported test suite).

### Dependency Isolation

The front end (lexer, parser, type checker) is pure Python with **no `llvmlite` dependency**. This means:
- `test_parser.py` and `test_typecheck.py` run on any Python 3.8+ system
- `test_codegen.py` requires `llvmlite` and `clang` but is the only place that imports them
- If codegen dependencies are missing, the suite auto-skips those tests without failure

## Implementation Notes

### Data Structures

- **AST** — typed dataclasses defined in `ast_nodes.py`, one per language construct. The parser builds the tree bottom-up using recursive descent. Array, record, and pointer access use selector nodes for uniform representation.
- **Type System** — modular type hierarchy: base scalar types (`INTEGER`, `REAL`, `BOOLEAN`, `CHAR`, `WORD`, plus feature-gated `INTEGER32`/`INTEGER64`) plus composite types (ARRAY, RECORD, SET, POINTER) and callable types (PROCEDURE, FUNCTION). Implements Pascal's strict assignment rules with explicit type compatibility checks.
- **Symbol Table** — scope stack with parent chain for lexical scoping. Symbols are tagged by kind (var, const, function, procedure, parameter, type) to support scope-aware lookups and proper shadowing rules.
- **Codegen** — direct LLVM IR emission using `llvmlite`. No intermediate IR; the AST walks directly to LLVM instructions. Globals receive proper zero initializers; named constants are folded at compile time; function arguments are coerced (pointer bitcasts, integer width adjustments) to match callee signatures.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Type checking before codegen** — all type errors are caught and reported before any IR is generated, guaranteeing that successful type checking implies compilable output.
- **Minimal operator overloading** — each operator works on specific types with explicit type rules, avoiding the ambiguity that makes compiled languages harder to reason about.
- **Array bounds at compile time** — constant expressions in array declarations enable `sizeof` and layout calculations to be resolved during parsing, essential for systems programming.
- **Vintage integer width by default** — `INTEGER` lowers to signed 16-bit LLVM IR. Wider signed integers are extension-only (`INTEGER32`, `INTEGER64`) and must be enabled deliberately with `-f wide-integers`; there is no compatibility flag that makes default `INTEGER` 32-bit.

## Requirements

**For parsing and type checking:**
- Python 3.8+
- No external dependencies (pure Python implementation)

**For code generation (LLVM IR → native executable):**
- Python 3.8+
- `llvmlite` (for LLVM IR generation via Python)
- `clang` (recent versions; needed for native compilation and linking)
  - A harmless target-triple override warning from LLVM is expected and safe to ignore

**Note:** If `llvmlite` or `clang` are unavailable, the parser and type checker still work fully; only codegen tests are skipped.
