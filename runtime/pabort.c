/*
 * Runtime support for ABORT.
 *
 * Manual: ABORT(CONST STRING, WORD, WORD) "stops program execution in the same
 * way as an internal runtime error. The STRING (or LSTRING) is an error
 * message; the first WORD is an error code ...; and the second WORD ... will
 * appear in a field called STATUS."
 *
 * We surface the message, error code, and status on stderr and then abort(),
 * matching the "same way as an internal runtime error" wording (the internal
 * runtime-error path also calls abort()). The message is passed as an explicit
 * (pointer, length) pair because Pascal STRING/LSTRING values are not
 * null-terminated.
