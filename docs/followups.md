# Follow-ups / tracked tech-debt

A home for known, non-blocking issues we have consciously decided to defer, so
they are not lost. Each item states what it is, where it lives, why it matters,
a suggested resolution, and how to verify the fix. Status is one of OPEN /
IN-PROGRESS / DONE.

These are not bugs that produce wrong output today; they are seams worth
closing when the surrounding code is next touched. Items 1 and 2 were surfaced
while reviewing the lazy-extern / `INPUT`/`OUTPUT`-ownership work (checklist
S2.2.1 full form + S4.1).

## 1. Super-array remediation residue and device-heap boundary [OPEN]

**Where.** The D-001/D-002 historical evidence now lives in
`docs/old/discrepancies-super-array.md` and
`docs/old/discrepancies-remediation-plan.md`. Current implementation touchpoints
are `type_checker.py::_check_new_args`, `codegen/runtime_builtins.py::builtin_new`,
string-bound lowering in expression codegen, and DEVICE recission checks in the
type checker.

**What.** The observed D-001/D-002 gaps are remediated for normal host code:
`LOWER`/`UPPER` accept `STRING(n)` and `LSTRING(n)`, and one-dimensional
`SUPER ARRAY` pointer referents accept long-form `NEW(p, upper_bound)`. DEVICE
code intentionally does **not** support heap allocation; `NEW` and `DISPOSE` are
rejected during type checking with a device-code dynamic-allocation diagnostic,
including long-form `NEW(p, upper_bound)`.

**Why it matters.** The shipped support is deliberately narrower than the full
vintage surface. Long-form `NEW` currently covers the one-dimensional
super-array allocation case needed by D-002; it does not imply variant-record
long-form `NEW`, multi-dimensional super-array heap allocation, or GPU/device
heap allocation. Also, allocation sizing for heap super arrays does not yet
establish a general ABI for preserving dynamic upper-bound metadata for later
`UPPER(p^)`-style queries.

**Suggested resolution.** If future work expands super arrays, decide the runtime
representation first: how dynamic bounds are stored, how dereferenced super-array
bounds are recovered, and how kernel buffer bounds are passed. For DEVICE code,
prefer caller-provided buffers and explicit bound metadata over backend-specific
GPU allocator calls unless a real device heap design is approved.

**How to verify.** Keep the existing regression tests for normal-code
`LOWER`/`UPPER`, long-form super-array `NEW`, DEVICE string bounds, and DEVICE
heap recission. Add new differential probes before expanding beyond the current
subset, especially for multi-dimensional super arrays, `UPPER(p^)`, and any
variant-record long-form `NEW` behavior.
